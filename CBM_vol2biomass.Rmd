## Overview

The main change agent in [CBM](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/climate-change/climate-change-impacts-forests/carbon-accounting/carbon-budget-model/13107) is forest growth. The models needs increments of carbon for its three above ground carbon pools, `Merch` for stem wood carbon of merchantable-sized trees, `Foliage` for foliage-carbon, and `Other` which combines bark, branches and the stem wood carbon of live, nonmerchantable-sized trees. This module translates stand-level volume $m^3/ha$ values the user provides into the tonnes of carbon/ha increments that [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) needs to simulate annual carbon fluxes and estimate stocks in [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) simulations. This is an implementation of the @boudewyn2007 stand-level volume to biomass translation. Other  [CBM](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) implementation use the same equations, but we added a smoothing algorithm to fill-in the gap between age 0 and the age at which growth curves have data. In *SpaDES-speak*, this module has just one even. It only needs to be run once in simulations.

Like many statistical models, this translation is not always successful. The user is advised to review the resulting biomass increments as this are the only representation of vegetation dynamics in the [CBM](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) and [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git)

This module can be run independently of the [spadesCBM](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/spadesCBM.git) [deck](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html). It relies on multiple [`CBMutils`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/tree/development) functions described in the [CBMutils](Camille: add link to the CBMutils chapter). We describe how these functions relate to the @boudewyn2007 equations, and also describe our smoothing algorithm below.

## Background

The module uses the subset of @boudewyn2007 empirical models that calculate  volume-to-biomass conversion models for forested (treed) land. These were developed from plot data supplied from forest inventory agencies throughout Canada. Figure 3.1 (Figure 3 in @boudewyn2007) outline the model development procedure (upper) and the calculation workflow (lower). We matched our calculation and functions to the @boudewyn2007 calculation workflow.

## Inputs

The pieces of information needed to apply the @boudewyn2007 conversion models are growth curves, the leading species for that growth curve, and where on the landscape (which pixel) each growth curve applies to. The user provides the stand-level $m^3/ha$ via `userGCM3`. In this module, `gcMeta` links the growth curve to the leading species,
and the objects `level3DT`, [`ecozones`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html), and [`spatialUnit`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) provide location information. Table 1 lists the inputs to this module. Inputs `table3` through `table7` are the @boudewyn2007 parameters which are hosted on the National Forest Information System website. We provide the `cbmAdmin` object to help user with the equivalence between provincial and territorial boudaries, Canadian ecozones (**INSERT LINK AND REF HERE**), and [`spatialUnit`](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html)

## Module functioning

This module begins by reading-in the provided growth curves, matches the correct @boudewyn2007 parameters (`table3` through `table7`) to the location for each curve, makes sure the appropriate metadata is available to apply the parameters to the growth curve and processes each curve. It outputs some visuals for the growth curves, the translations of these curves, and the final curves that have gone through a smoothing process if needed. Plots of the cumulative curve for each pool (`totMerch`, `fol`, `other`) raw translation and smoothed curves are saved in the outputs folder of the SpaDES project. It main output is `growth_increments`, a matrix of yearly carbon increments that is passed along to the [CBM_core](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_core.git) module.

### Input check

This module starts off by checking if the provided growth curves (user-provided via `userGcM3`) are in annual time steps. If not, interpolated values between provided steps are added. Growth curves are saved as a ggplot object in the simulation list (`sim$...`) for visual inspection (`volCurves`) anytime during and post simulation. 

### Choosing parameters

The @boudewyn2007 models where developed for most locations in the managed forests of Canada. They were developed, when enough data were available, by [ecozone](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html) and stand-level leading species. For ecozone and species combinations that did not have enough data for model development, the user will  have to find alternatives. We chose to replace the models that did not converge with models of similar species in similar ecozone in our example. These are the ecozones in the tables 3 through 7 (`table3`, `table4`, `table5`, `table6` and `table7`):

  |ID |              Name |
  |---|------------------|
  | 4 |      Taiga Plains |
  | 5 | Taiga Shield West |
  | 6 | Boreal Shield West |
  | 7 | Atlantic Maritime |
  | 9 |     Boreal Plains |
  | 10 |  Subhumid Prairies |
  | 12 | Boreal Cordillera |
  | 13 |  Pacific Maritime |
  | 14 | Montane Cordillera |

These are the ones that are not:

  | Original ID |             Name | Equivalent ID | Equivalent ID Name |
  |---|------------------|---|------------------|
  | 8 |  Mixedwood Plains  | 7 |  Atlantic Maritime |
  | 11 |  Taiga Cordillera | 4 | taiga plains |
  | 15 |      Hudson Plains | 6 | Boreal Shield West |
  | 16 |  Taiga Shield East | 5 | Taiga Shield West |
  | 17 | Boreal Shield East | 6 | Boreal Shield West |
  | 18 |  Semiarid Prairies | 10 | Subhumid Prairies |
  
In `table5` in the NFIS website, there are 5/13 possible jurisdiction id (`juris_id` column). These are the provinces available: AB BC NB NF NT. For the provinces that did nothave a match, we chose the following equivalence in our example:

 | Province | Equivalent |
 |---|------------|
 | PE | NB |
 | QC | NB |
 | ON | NB |
 | MB | AB |
 | SK | AB |
 | YK | NT |
 | NU | NT |
 | NS | NB |

### From $m^3$ to carbon 

Each growth curve is processed by species, one at a time. This requires a match between the species specified in @boudewyn2007 and the leading species associated with each curve provided by the user. We provide means to complete this match and full-stops if there is not match. Growth curves are often developed by strata or multiple characteristics. The simulation list object `curveID` permits the user to identify multiple columns to define growth curves. In our example, the column `gcids` is used to identify unique growth curves.

Once we have all the required information assembled for our study area, we process the information by species, as the @boudewyn2007 parameters are leading species-specific ([`CBMutils::cumPoolsCreate()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/development/R/Boudewyn_cumPoolsCreate.R)), and for each species, we processes each growth curve one at a time (using [`CBMutils::convertM3biom()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/bd30825d38c1d8abe7d0d002d494745e19b42ec5/R/Boudewyn_growthCurves.R#L259)). Values of merchantable volume at each age and @boudewyn parameters available on the [NFIS](https://predictiveecology.github.io/spadesCBM/lexicon.html), are used in Equation 1 (matches Eq. 1 in Figure 1) to get *b_m*, total stem wood biomass of merchantable-sized live trees (biomass includes stumps and tops), in metric tonnes per ha ([`CBMutils::b_m()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/bd30825d38c1d8abe7d0d002d494745e19b42ec5/R/Boudewyn_growthCurves.R#L28) used in [`CBMutils::convertM3biom()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/bd30825d38c1d8abe7d0d002d494745e19b42ec5/R/Boudewyn_growthCurves.R#L259)).

**Equation 1.** *b_m = a X* $volume^b$  
Where 
- volume = gross merchantable volume/ha (net in B.C.) of all live trees (volume does not include stumps, tops, or trees< merchantable DBH), in m3/ha.
- a,b = non-linear model parameters fit separately by jurisdiction, ecozone, and lead tree species (Table 3 in @boudewyn2007).

The stem wood content of smaller trees in tonnes/ha (*b_n*) are calculated via Equation 2 ([CBMutils::nmfac()][`CBMutils`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/tree/development) used in [`CBMutils::convertM3biom()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/bd30825d38c1d8abe7d0d002d494745e19b42ec5/R/Boudewyn_growthCurves.R#L259) matches Eq. 2 in Figure 1). 

**Equation 2.** *nonmerchfactor = k + a X b_*$m^b$  
Where
- *nonmerchfactor = b_nm/b_m*
- *b_nm = b_m + b_n*
- *k*, *a*, and *b* are model parameters fit separately by jurisdiction, ecozone, and lead tree species (Table 4 in @boudewyn2007).

The stem wood biomass of live, sapling-sized trees in tonnes/ha (*b_s*) is extracted from Equation 3 ([`CBMutils::sapfac()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/bd30825d38c1d8abe7d0d002d494745e19b42ec5/R/Boudewyn_growthCurves.R#L103) used in [`CBMutils::convertM3biom()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/bd30825d38c1d8abe7d0d002d494745e19b42ec5/R/Boudewyn_growthCurves.R#L259) matches Eq. 3 in Figure 1).

**Equation 3.** *saplingfactor = k + a X b_*$m^b$  
Where
- *saplingfactor = b_snm/b_nm*
- *b_snm = b_nm + b_s*
- *k*, *a*, and *b* are model parameters fit separately by jurisdiction, ecozone, and lead tree species (Table 5 in @boudewyn2007). Note that sparse data resulted in incomplete coverage of managed forests of Canada. Module users have to decide on parameter selection appropriate for their study area, as we do in our  [CBM_vol2biomass](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBM_vol2biomass.git) example.

Proportions of total tree biomass in stem wood, stem bark, branches and foliage for live trees of all sizes are calculated with Equations 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively ([`CBMutils::biomProp()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/bd30825d38c1d8abe7d0d002d494745e19b42ec5/R/Boudewyn_growthCurves.R#L154) returns a vector of proportion that matches Eq. 4, 5, 6 and 7 in Figure 1 and is used in [`CBMutils::convertM3biom()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/bd30825d38c1d8abe7d0d002d494745e19b42ec5/R/Boudewyn_growthCurves.R#L259)).


**Equation 4.** $P_(stemwood)$ *= 1/(1 +* $e^(a1+a2xvol+a3xlvol)$ *+* $e^(b1+b2xvol+b3xlvol)$ *+* $e^(c1+c2xvol+c3xlvol)$ *)*  
**Equation 5.** $P_(bark)$ *= 1/(1 +* $e^(a1+a2xvol+a3xlvol)$ *+* $e^(b1+b2xvol+b3xlvol)$ *+* $e^(c1+c2xvol+c3xlvol)$ *)*  
**Equation 6.** $P_(branches)$ *= 1/(1 +* $e^(a1+a2xvol+a3xlvol)$ *+* $e^(b1+b2xvol+b3xlvol)$ *+* $e^(c1+c2xvol+c3xlvol)$ *)*  
**Equation 7.** $P_(foliage)$ *= 1/(1 +* $e^(a1+a2xvol+a3xlvol)$ *+* $e^(b1+b2xvol+b3xlvol)$ *+* $e^(c1+c2xvol+c3xlvol)$ *)*  
Where
- *vol* gross merchantable volume per ha (provided by the user)
- *lvol* is the natural logarithm of (*vol* + 5)
- *a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3* are model parameters fit separately by jurisdiction, ecozone and lead tree species (Table 6 in @boudewyn2007).
e.

Our [`CBMutils::biomProp()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/bd30825d38c1d8abe7d0d002d494745e19b42ec5/R/Boudewyn_growthCurves.R#L154) function also implements the caps on proportion models (Table 7 in  @boudewyn2007). Tonnes of biomass per hectare are converted to tonnes of carbon per hectare in our [`CBMutils::cumPoolsCreate()`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/blob/development/R/Boudewyn_cumPoolsCreate.R) functions (this is currently a constant at 0.5 tonnes of carbon per tonnes of biomass but users can modify this value).

### Smoothing algorithm

Forest management is based on forest inventory data. These were developed to calculate how forest growth for the purposes of sustainable production of forests products ($m^3/ha$). Tree diameters are measured for these purposes, and by consequence, trees only start getting measured once they have reached a minimum diameter (which varies per jurisdiction). This leaves a gap between age 0 of the stand and the age at which trees reach this specified diameter. To fill this gap we use a smoothing algorithm based on the Chapman_Richards function (@gove2019). We apply this smoothing to the cumulative curves for each of the three pools (`totMerch`, `fol`, `other`).

The module automatically plots both the direct translation (no smoothing `totMerch`, `fol`, `other`)) and the smoothed (`totMerch_New`, `fol_New`, `other_New`) curves for all three pools. These figures are save in the SpaDES project folder under outputs/CBM_vol2biomass_figures/cumPools_smoothed_postChapmanRichards.png. The [CBMutils::cumPoolsSmooth](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/CBMutils/tree/development) function implements the smoothing procedure.
